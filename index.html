<h1>Nick James</h1>
</div>
<p>Hello everyone! This site is under construction. I am a PhD student at the University of Sydney.
</p>
<p>My undergrad degree is a B.A. in pure maths including Part III from Trinity College, Cambridge. So I'm familiar with Australia, the UK, the US, and China, and always willing to chat.</p>
<p>I can be contacted at max.c.menzies at gmail dot com. I do not have a Tsinghua University email address, but you may add me on Wechat as username max-menzies. My Chinese name is 孟思哲。</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I am interested in both pure and applied maths. In pure maths, I've studied algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry, for many years, particularly p-curvature. In applied mathematics, I have the honour to work with my best friend for 25 years, Nick James. We're working on using pure mathematical techniques in problems phrased in statistics but with an applied mathematics flavour, with many experiments. I encourage all researchers to sign up for an <a href="https://orcid.org">ORCID iD</a>. It is a digital identifier that takes seconds to set up. Mine is <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-8435.">0000-0002-9907-8435</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Papers</h2>
<p> I encourage all academics to submit their work to an open access archive such as arXiv. All my papers can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/menzies_m_1.html">my personal arXiv page</a>.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>I passed HSK 4, the Mandarin Chinese equivalent of B2, in December 2019. I am very interested in practising Mandarin with anyone.</p>
<p>I finished the Duolingo course in French. I am out of practice now, but will wish to practise much more in the future.</p>
<p>I also finished the Duolingo course in Spanish. I think this language should be taught much more in Australia than it currently is.</p>
